This repository holds all materials related to WRF-Hydro/NWM training.

#How to use this repo
Each training will have its own directory. The directory should hold all presentations, code, and user guides used for that training. The directory structure should remain unchanged to as much extent as possible. Large binary files (e.g. testcases) should not be added to the repository through git but rather attached to the release. See below for details on releases.

#Releases and training materials
Training materials will be finalized as part of a GitHub Release. You can read about GitHub releases here: (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)

###Advantages of releases:

* They mark a specfic state of the repo, much like a commit hash. However, unlike a commit hash they are universal accross version control systems. The concept of a tag is ubiquitous. 

* Binary files can be attached to the release so that all data used in the training sites along-side the code in a versioned tag, making it easy to distribute the proper materials

#Issues and projects
This is maybe pie in the sky, but if we all get on board this will streamline thigns immensely. No need to have discussions, to-do lists, and problems in multiple places. Keeping everything in GitHub allows for linking issues between the WRF-Hydro source and the trainings. If issue *blank* is caused by a documented issue in the source code, this can be referenced in one place.
