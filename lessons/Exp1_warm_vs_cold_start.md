The goal of this lesson is to run the wrf-hydro model under cold start and warm start and examine the differences in the output files.

# Step 1. Create simulation directory

We will create a directory for our simulation

```bash
mkdir -p ~/wrf-hydro-training/output/lesson4/cold_start
ls ~/wrf-hydro-training/output/lesson4/
```
