    "# Lesson 0 - Getting started\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover the basics of getting started with the WRF-Hydro training environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "The easiest and recommended way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/training/) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Docker >= v.17.12\n",
    "* Web browser (Google Chrome recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to get help and/or post issues\n",
    "If you have general questions about Docker, there are ample online resourves including the excellent Docker documentation at https://docs.docker.com/.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best place ask questions or post issues with these lessons is via the Issues page of the GitHub repository at https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_training/issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run\n",
    "Make sure you have Docker installed and that it can access your localhost ports. Most out-of-the-box Docker installations accepting all defaults will have this configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Open a terminal or PowerShell session**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Pull the wrfhydro/training Docker container for the desired code version**\n",
    "Each training container is specific to a release version of the WRF-Hydro source code, which can be found at https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public/releases. **Note: Training IS NOT SUPPORTED for bleeding-edge, unreleased code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue the following command in your terminal to pull a specific version of the training corresponding to your code release version. In this example, we will pull the training container for v5.0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker pull wrfhydro/training:v5.0.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Start the training container**\n",
    "Issue the following commnand in your terminal session to start the training Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run -p 8888:8888 -it wrfhydro/training`\n",
    "\n",
    "The container will start and perform a number of actions before startign the training. \n",
    "\n",
    "* First, the container will pull the model code corresponding to the specified major version, in this case v5.\n",
    "* Second, the container will pull an example test case compatible with the model code release.\n",
    "* Third, the container will launch a Jupyter Notebook server and echo the address to your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Port forwarding is setup with the `-p 8888:8888` argument, which maps *"
