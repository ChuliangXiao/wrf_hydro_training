    "## Overview\n",
    "In lesson 2 we covered the basics of constructing and running a WRF-Hydro simulation using a prepared domain for the 'Gridded' configuration. In this lesson, we will experiment with difference run-time options and do some basic visualization of the outputs using the Python library `xarray`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: If you have not completed lessons 2 and 3, please stop and do so now.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "The easiest way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/training/) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete description of the software environment used for this training please see [Getting started]().\n",
    "\n",
    "You may either execute commands by running each cell of this notebook. Alternatively, you may open a terminal in Jupyter Lab by selecting `New -> Terminal` in your `Home` tab of Jupyter Lab and input the commands manually if you prefer. \n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named `wrf-hydro-training`. If your materials are located in another directory, you will not be able to run the commands in this notebook inside Jupyter and will need to type them manually in your terminal session. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap of lessons 1 and 2, , compiling and running WRF-Hydro\n",
    "In this section, we will quickly recap the commands issued in Lessons 1 and 2 to compile WRF-Hydro and create our simulation directory. We will use the prepared domain for the remaining lessons, but feel free to replace the prepared domain with the domain you created in the geospatial hands-on training session. **NOTE: Your domain directory structure and filenames must match the prepared domain EXACTLY**\n",
