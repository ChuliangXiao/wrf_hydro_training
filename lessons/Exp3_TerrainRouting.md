Overland flow in WRF-Hydro is calculated using a fully-unsteady, explicit, finite-difference, diffusive wave formulation similar to that of Julien et al. (1995) and Ogden et al. (1997). The diffusive wave equation, while slightly more complicated, is, under some conditions, superior to the simpler and more traditionally used kinematic wave equation, because it accounts for backwater effects and allows for flow on adverse slopes. For more detailed information refer to [WRF-Hydro V5 Technical Description](https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/WRF-HydroV5TechnicalDescription.pdf). Here, we would like to turn the overland flow routing on and off and investigate the imapact of doing so on the streamflow simulations.
